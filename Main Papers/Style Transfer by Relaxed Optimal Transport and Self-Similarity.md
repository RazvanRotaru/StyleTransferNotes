### Definition

***Style Transfer by Relaxed Optimal Transport and Self-Similarity (STROTSS)*** is an optimization-based style transfer algorithm. 

This method is extended to allow user-specified point-to-point or region-to-region control over visual similarity between the style image and the output.


*Such guidance can be used to either achieve a particular visual effect or correct errors made by unconstrained style transfer.*
