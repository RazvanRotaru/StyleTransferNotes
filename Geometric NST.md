### Definition

There is a growing consensus that the **geometric deformations** artists used to make imaginative recreations of objects are worthy of consideration within [[Neural Style Transfer | NST]]. 

The literature is far less voluminous than for [[Texture NST]], but the subject is no less important.

Some methods are limited to specialized content domains such as faces [[The face of art - Landmark detection and geometric style in portraits | Yaniv et al.]], and text [[Controllable Artistic Style Transfer via Shape-Matching GAN | Yang et al.]].

*These methods produce excellent results. [[The face of art - Landmark detection and geometric style in portraits | Yaniv]] manages to characterize the geometric style of individual artists â€“ analysis of style is absent from the literature otherwise, style is defined by example.*
